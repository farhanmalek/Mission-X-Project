# Mission-X-Project
This repo showcases my Mission Ready L4 final project where I have built a full stack application using React, Node.js,Express and mySQL. 

I have leveraged these technologies to create a dummy version of an e-learning tool for school kids wanting to learn code.
The app allows the user to Signup as either a student or teacher, Login as either a student or teacher and access the project library pages where all projects can be filtered based on checkboxes.
The user can also access their personal profile using the drop down menu.
